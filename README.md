IÂ´m currently working on a couple of smaller projects. One of them is with communications agency <a href="https://ystory.no/" >Y-Story</a> and another is a website for a take-away restaurant that my friend own. Also looking forward to learning more on my second year at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

### Have a nice day!
